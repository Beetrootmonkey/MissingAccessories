Adds a hand full of Accessories I thought the game lacked and some Weapons I thought would be fun.

Currently adds the following items (list might not be up-to-date):
- BonetoothNecklace (gives a little bit of extra damage and armor pen depending on unique killed bosses/finished events (currently vanilla-only, sorry!))
- Stacked BonetoothNecklace (right-click a BonetoothNecklace with 20 stacks)
- Double Shackle (two Shackles combined)
- Triple Shackle (three Shackles combined)
- Quadruple Shackle (four Shackles combined)
- Razorblade Necklace (gives decent armor pen)
- Sawblade Necklace (gives a lot of armor pen)
- Daddy Bloon (a lot of mobility items combined)
- Really Good Boots (like, all the mobility items combined)
- Frozen Paladin Shield (Paladin Shield and Frozen Shell combined)
- Shiny Carapace (Shiny Stone upgrade that gives defence, aggro and damage reduction)
- Iceborn Gauntlet (a lot of defensive items combined)
- Strange Bundle of Bloons (all the single balloons combined)
- True Blade Breaker (Breaker Blade upgrade)
- Terra Buster (Terra Blade upgrade)


Currently this mod doesn't feature a config file, but I will try to implement one if I ever find out how.
If you find any bugs, you can open a new issue on github: https://github.com/Beetrootmonkey/Moonstones/issues.
I'm not very active, so I might not get around to fixing anything, sorry :3
